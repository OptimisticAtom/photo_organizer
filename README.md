# photo_organizer
#### create an easy to navigate file tree for browsing photos

## How it works
#### All photos are initially sorted by year last modified

#### If there are ten or more photos taken on a given day they will be given their own folder

#### Otherwise the pictures are left in their respective year folder



## Setup
#### First create a folder named New_Memories and a folder named Old_Memories

#### Then put the pictures you want to organize into
